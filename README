README file for the GD project
==============================

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ah, there are _A LOT_ of them. You can read a _very_ detailed list in
the `DEPS' file. Most of these deps are easy to instal, but please send
us an email if you find something really hard to be installed and we'll
try to help you.

If you are running a Debian based system, I suggest you to install
everything you can from apt (you obviously have to respect the version
numbers that are present in the DEPS file). And then use the
'''virtualenv''' package to install the others.

To use virtualenv, install it (the package name is python-virtualenv in
Debian) and then do the following::

 $ virtualenv /home/<youruser>/gabdigital
 $ source /home/<youruser>/gabdigital/bin/activate

After sourcing the '''activate''' script, you'll be inside your virtual
env. So you can easily install packages using the '''pip''' tool (you
can also use '''easy_install''', choose at your will).


Configuration Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, you'll have to define the settings of your app. It's quite
easy. Just copy the '''gd/conf.py.sample''' file to '''gd/conf.py''' and
then edit it as you wish. It's quite simple to understand it. You just
have to remember that it's a python file, so you have to follow it's
sintax and other rules.


Wordpress integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our application is integrated with wordpress in two points: the user
database and the content management. To acomplish both points correctly
setup, you'll need to follow the following steps:

 * Setup a wordpress site (no, I'm not gonna tell you how, please refer
   to the wordpress documentation)

 * Install both '''exapi''' and '''wpgd''' plugins available in our
   repositories as wordpress plugins. (yes, just copy them to the
   wp-content/plugins dir and enable them in the '''plugins''' screen)

 * Enable the xmlrpc interface for the wordpress site you just
   setup. You'll find it in "Settings > Writing > XML-RPC".


The python application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is the setup the rest of the database. Another easy step,
just run the following command in your project directory::

 $ python ./gd/model.py

After that, all we have to do is to run the built in development server
by executting the `add' command::

 $ ./bin/gdappd

After that, you can just point your browser to the http://localhost:5000
url and see the system running.

There are currently a few views ready to be tested. Here are some:

 * /                (The project index)
 * /admin           (The user administration)


Buzzwatcher
~~~~~~~~~~~

We have another python program called '''buzzwatcher'''. It's main
responsibility is to grab information from various social networks about
running audiences. Currently the only supported social network is
twitter. It's gonna change in the future, we have plans to support
identica too.

Anyway, to run it, you will have to run the following command::

 $ ./bin/buzzwatcherd

Remember that it'll not do anything before you create a new audience in
the admin interface. Make sure your configuration parameters are right,
including your twitter account information.

Enjoy!
