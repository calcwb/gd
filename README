README file for the AD project
==============================

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are running a Debian based system, you just need to install the
following packages:

 * python-elixir
 * python-flask

Running the app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, you have to setup the database. To do it, just run the
following commands in your project directory::

 $ cd admin
 $ python model.py

After that, all we have to do is to run the built in development server
by issuing the following commands::

 $ python webapp.py

After that, you can just point your browser to the http://localhost:5000
url and see the system running.

There are currently a few views ready to be tested. Here are some:

 * /admin/audience        (Lists audiences)
 * /admin/audience/new    (Form that creates a new audience)
 * /admin/audience/<id>   (See the details/edit an audience)
