README file for the AD project
==============================

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are running a Debian based system, you need to install the
following packages:

 * python-elixir
 * python-flask (>=0.7.2)
 * python-pip
 * python-zmq

And then install some softwares not packaged yet (as of the date of this
commit)::

 $ pip install gevent-socketio gevent_zeromq

It is very important to notice that our app WILL NOT WORK if you install
any version different from the 0.2.0 of the `gevent-socketio' library.

Running the app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, you have to setup the database. To do it, just run the
following commands in your project directory::

 $ python ad/model.py

After that, all we have to do is to run the built in development server
by executting the `add' command::

 $ ./ad-d

After that, you can just point your browser to the http://localhost:5000
url and see the system running.

There are currently a few views ready to be tested. Here are some:

 * /admin/audience        (Lists audiences)
 * /admin/audience/new    (Form that creates a new audience)
 * /admin/audience/<id>   (See the details/edit an audience)

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
