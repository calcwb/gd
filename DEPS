Python stuff
============


Lib:        python
Version:    2.7.x
Link:       http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/Python-2.7.2.tar.bz2
Install:    ./configure && make && make install
Comments:   If you choose to compile your python interpreter, you must link it
            against all optional libraries it requests. Like libreadline and so. I
            strongly suggest you to upgrade the python package of your favorite
            distro if it's not updated enough.


Lib:        python-imaging-library (PIL)

PHP stuff
=========


Lib:        wordpress
Version:    3.2.1
Link:       http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
Install:    Wordpress package is a self-contained instance, so to install it,
            you usually just need to decompress the tarball in a directory
            visible by your webserver and it's done. Distributions like Debian
            has a more complex approach to make it possible to run more than one
            instance with the same source code and to install different versions
            at the same time a system. But I guess it's too much work for a single
            site.
Comments:   To make wordpress work properly, you'll need to install/enable
            mysql and gd (the graphics library).


Lib:        Twig
Version:    1.6.0
Link:       https://github.com/fabpot/Twig/tarball/v1.6.0
Install:    All you have to do is to install the library in a directory
            visible by the PHP include system. In debian, /usr/share/php
            is the right place. It's possible to install twig using pear
            too. The following simple commands do this job:
            # pear channel-discover pear.twig-project.org
            # pear install twig/Twig

Lib:        HTTP-Reques
Version:    -
Link:       http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request/
Install:    apt-get install php-http-reququest
